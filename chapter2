Exercise 2.21

public Pet(String petsName)
{
  name = petsName;
}

Exercise 2.22

public Date(string month, int day, int year)
{
}

Exercise 2.23

The getBalance method and the getPrice method are both public members and integer types.
The getBalance method returns the balance field.
The getPrice method returns the price field, which is equal to the cost.

Exercise 2.24

A call to getBalance can be characterised as "What is the balance?"

Exercise 2.25

No, the return statement in the body of the method does not need to be changed.
The name of an accessor method does not need to relate to the name of the field associated with it.

Exercise 2.26

/**
 * Return the total amount of money collected
 */
public int getTotal()
{
  return total;
}

Exercise 2.27

Missing return statement.

Exercise 2.28

The getPrice and printTicket are both public members.
The getPrice is type integer.
The printTicket is type void (does not have a return type).

Exercise 2.29

No, insertMoney and printTicket do not have return types because they have void in the method header.

Exercise 2.30

Ticket machine created with price 100.
The getBalance method returns a value of 0.
insertMoney method called with value 50 inputted.
The getBalance method now returns value 50.

Exercise 2.31

The setPrice header does not have TicketMachine in it (the class name).

Exercise 2.32

public void setPrice(int cost)
{
  price = cost;
}

Exercise 2.33

/**
* Increase score by the given number of points.
*/
public void increase(int points)
{
  score += points;
}

Exercise 2.34

Yes, increase changes the state of score therefore it is a mutator.
You could demonstrate it by checking the value of score before and after the increase method is executed.

Exercise 2.35

/**
* Reduce price by the given amount.
*/
public void discount(int amount)
{
price -= amount;
}

Exercise 2.36

My cat has green eyes.

Exercise 2.37

public void prompt()
{
  System.out.println("Please insert the correct amount of money.");
}

Exercise 2.38

The string "price" would be printed rather than the value of price:
# price cents.
